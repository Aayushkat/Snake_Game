üêç Classic Snake Game (OpenGL/GLUT)Welcome to the repository for a classic Snake game implementation, built in C using the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) for rendering.This project focuses on implementing robust game logic within a console application framework, while utilizing the power of OpenGL for visual output.‚ú® Features HighlightThe game provides a smooth, tile-based experience with key functionality:Grid-Based Movement: Fluid control across a $25 \times 25$ grid.Intelligent Collision: Checks for game-ending collisions with the boundary walls and the snake's own body.Real-time Graphics: Renders the game world using OpenGL and a custom tile set.Dynamic Scoring: Score increases as the snake consumes apples ($+$), with faster movement as the snake grows.Automatic Restart: Implements a brief timeout after game over, followed by an automatic reset for quick re-playability.Dual Input Support: Accepts both W/A/S/D and standard Arrow Keys for player movement.üõ†Ô∏è Build & Setup InstructionsDependenciesTo successfully compile this game, you must have the following libraries installed and linked on your system:C Compiler (GCC/MinGW)FreeGLUT (Graphics Utility Toolkit)OpenGL / GLUWindows Libraries (winmm, gdi32 for timer and system functions)snake_tileset.c (The custom asset file for the game's graphics, which must be present in the same directory as the main C file).Compilation CommandUse the following command in your terminal to compile the source file (Snake.c) and link all required libraries:# Compile and link for a Windows environment
